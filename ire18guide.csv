3951,Finding the story: Immigration,"There are some 320 million people in the U.S., and 43 million of them were born abroad.

3990,Technology and Tools Track: Online security for journalists (Sponsored by Knight Foundation),"Safety and security online are important for all users, but especially for journalists in the field conducting sensitive, difficult, and sometimes dangerous reporting. According to a recent study of more than 2,700 newsroom managers and journalists from 130 countries, at least half of those surveyed don’t use any tools or methods to protect their data and information online. Given the importance of journalism to open societies everywhere, it's important to ensure that newsrooms and journalists are equipped with the tools and training they need to be successful — and safe — while doing their work. Attend this workshop to learn how to protect yourself and your news organization from hacking, phishing, malware, other digital attacks and censorship — for the upcoming election season and beyond.
